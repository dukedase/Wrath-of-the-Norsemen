 WRATH_OF_NORSEMEN_NAME:0 "Wrath of the Norsemen"
 WRATH_OF_NORSEMEN_DESC:0 "Europe is in chaos.  Charlemagne was not successful in Iberia or northern Germania, and upon his passing his Empire split into many feuding Kingdoms. The Karlings continue to dominate much of Christian Europe, but with Muslim incursions in Iberia, and Pagans invading from the North and East, their legitimacy is beginning to crumble.  For centuries Popes have tried to push back the heathens, but their efforts have been thus far forlorn.  Heresies continue to spring up, decaying the Popes authority even further.  However, succession troubles in England may leave the region open for conversion or conquest, and the new King of Castille seems ready to strike the Muslims in Iberia."
